            <h2>Harry Potter</h2>
            <p>
                Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by British author J. K. Rowling. This movie is great and I really love it. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
